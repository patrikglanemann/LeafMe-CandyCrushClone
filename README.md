I generally followed a tutorial by Ania Kubow [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD5sZWxwJUk) but changed the logic a tiny bit here and there and added my own styling.
Instead of candies I use leafs, you can only put three together (not four or even more).

The leafs are cc0 clipart, I changed the colour as needed and created a background image for the page.
